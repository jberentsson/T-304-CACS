\begin{questions}

% PROBLEM 1
\question
Use L'H\^opital's rule as many times as necessary to find the following limit. State \emph{why} you can use L'H\^opital's rule. (What condition needs to be satisfied?)
\[
L = \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{(x+1) e^{-x} - 1}{\sin^2 x}
\]

% PROBLEM 2
\question
Consider the function
\[
f(x) = \frac{x^2+2 x+1}{x^2+3 x+3}
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a sketch of the function and observe where it reaches its smallest and largest value. Use GeoGebra or any other tool for plotting.
\item State what the value of $f'(x)$ is at the points $x$ where $f(x)$ reaches its smallest and largest value (``bottom of the valley'', ``peak of the mountain'').
\item Find a formula for $f'(x)$. Simplify it fully.
\item Solve the equation $f'(x) = 0$. This gives the location of the maximum and minimum.
\end{enumerate}
